Lidar-Camera Clibration
This work is based on the single frame Lidar Camera calibration. 
It takes 2 inputs:
 a) 1 pcd file containing the lidar point clouds containing the points of the calibration boards.
 b) 1 image file containg the image of the calibration board.
 
 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
  a) clone the repository to your local directory. (eg., $HOME/Lidar-Cam-Calib)
  b) navigate to the directory using terminal.
  c) mkdir build
  d) cd build
  e) cmake ..
  f) make
  
  Make sure to change the paths of the PCL and the OpenCV directory in the CMakeLists.txt.
  
  Run Instructions:
   ./teste6 pointcloud1.pcd image1.jpg
  
  Here, pointcloud1.pcd is the point cloud file acquired from the Lidar sensor.
  image1.jpg contains the image file acquired from the camera sensor.
   the calibration board is the FOV of both the sensors.
  The final output is a 4x4 transformation matrix between the lidar and the stereo sensor.
