Lidar-Camera Clibration
This work is based on the single frame Lidar Camera calibration. 
It takes 2 inputs:
 a) 1 pcd file containing the lidar point clouds containing the points of the calibration boards.
 b) 1 image file containg the image of the calibration board.
 
 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
  a) clone the repository to your local directory. (eg., $HOME/Lidar-Cam-Calib)
  b) navigate to the directory.yusing terminal.
  c) mkdir build
  d) cd build
  e) cmake ..
  f) make
  
  Make sure to change the paths of the PCL and the OpenCV directory in the CMakeLists.txt.
  
  RUN INstructions:
   ./teste6 pointcloud1.pcd image1.jpg
  
  Here, pointcloud1.pcd contains the lidar point cloud. and image1.jpg contains the image file.
  It should result in a 4x4 transformation matrix between the lidar and the stereo sensor.
